# Rust Crypto Tool Technical Specifications

## Overview

The Rust Crypto Tool is designed to provide secure cryptographic operations through a command-line interface. This document outlines the technical specifications of the implemented cryptographic functionalities.

## Hashing

### Algorithm

The tool uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for computing hash values.

### Implementation

- Utilizes the `ring` library for cryptographic primitives.
- Input data is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.
- Output hash values are encoded in hexadecimal format for readability.

## Encryption and Decryption

### Algorithm

Symmetric encryption and decryption are performed using the AES-256-CBC algorithm.

### Implementation

- AES encryption and decryption operations are handled by the `ring` library.
- Input plaintext is encrypted using the AES-256-CBC algorithm with a provided secret key.
- Encrypted data is returned in base64-encoded format for portability and readability.
- Decryption reverses the process, decrypting the ciphertext using the same secret key.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

### Usage

The CLI accepts commands for hashing, encryption, and decryption, along with necessary input parameters.

### Command Structure

- `hash`: Computes the hash of a given input string.
  - Syntax: `rust_crypto_tool hash "input string"`
- `encrypt`: Encrypts a plaintext string using a specified secret key.
  - Syntax: `rust_crypto_tool encrypt --key <secret_key> "plaintext"`
- `decrypt`: Decrypts a ciphertext string using a specified secret key.
  - Syntax: `rust_crypto_tool decrypt --key <secret_key> "ciphertext"`

### Input Validation

- The tool validates input parameters to ensure correct usage of cryptographic operations.
- Checks are performed to verify the presence of required parameters and the validity of provided keys.

## Security Considerations

- The tool utilizes established cryptographic algorithms and libraries to ensure security.
- Input validation is enforced to prevent misuse and potential security vulnerabilities.
- Continuous monitoring and updates are recommended to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC.
- Integration of advanced encryption modes and key management techniques.
- Implementation of cryptographic protocols for secure communication.
