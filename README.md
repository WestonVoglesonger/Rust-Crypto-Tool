# Rust Crypto Tool

## Description
Rust Crypto Tool is a command-line based cryptographic utility designed to perform secure and efficient cryptographic operations. Built using Rust, it leverages the language's inherent safety and speed to offer robust features such as hashing, encryption, and decryption.

## Features
- **Hashing**: Utilize SHA-256 for hashing operations.
- **Encryption**: Symmetric encryption using AES-256-CBC.
- **Decryption**: Corresponding decryption for AES-256-CBC encrypted data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install them using rustup by following the instructions here: [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation
Clone the repository and build the project with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust_crypto_tool.git
cd rust_crypto_tool
cargo build --release
```

The built executable will be located in ./target/release.

## Usage

### Hashing
To compute the hash of a string:
`bashCopy code./target/release/rust_crypto_tool hash "input string"`

### Encryption
To encrypt a string with a secret key:
`./target/release/rust_crypto_tool encrypt --key "your_secret_key" "plaintext to encrypt"`

### Decryption
To decrypt a string with the corresponding secret key:
`code./target/release/rust_crypto_tool decrypt --key "your_secret_key" "ciphertext to decrypt"`

Ensure that the key and the encryption algorithm used for decryption match those used during encryption.

### Examples

#### Hashing
`./target/release/rust_crypto_tool hash "Hello, Rust!"`

##### Output:
`SHA-256 hash: abc123... [truncated]`

#### Encryption
`./target/release/rust_crypto_tool encrypt --key "mysecretpassword" "Encrypt this text"`

##### Output:
`Encrypted: YWJjMTIz... [base64 encoded]`

#### Decryption
`./target/release/rust_crypto_tool decrypt --key "mysecretpassword" "YWJjMTIz..."`
##### Output:
`Decrypted text: Encrypt this text`
